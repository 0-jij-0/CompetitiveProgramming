## Notes about Problem Solving

First of all, congratulations on your decision to start learning and practicing Competitive Programming! Here are some blogs discussing how to approach and think about a specific problem...

- [How to read problem statements](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/62730)

- [How to come up with the solutions: techniques](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/20548)

Before moving to the next step, starting our problem solving journey, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xi6knk/there_is_nothing_better_than_grinding_leetcode/) is a Reddit post funnily addressing problem solving, and I hope that along the way you'll be able to relate to its essence.

## How to practice Competitive Programming (0-jij-0 version)
I already showed you many blogs of grandmasters (way better than me) discussing how to practice and train. In the end you should find the formula that suits you the most, and that's why I will share my opinion on how to practice:

- Solve 1 [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com) problem EVERY day: This atomic habit, if followed for a good period of time, will make you never worry about a programming interview ever again, sharpen your language skills and keep you in the problem solving environment. Note that the level of difficulty of the problem doesn't matter, what matters is that you solve one problem everyday and never skip a day.

- Participate in every possible [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com) and [AtCoder](https://atcoder.jp) contest: Solving problems offline is a great practicing technique, but participating in contests will make you learn how to perform under pressure, and expose you to problems you have no previous information about. This is also a great way to train your brain.

- After a contest, upsolve at least one question that you didn't solve during contest: You should make sure that you learn something new after each contest, that's why by upsolving such a problem - either by taking more time to think about it post-contest or afterwards looking at the editorial - you add some problem solving pattern to your skill-set and soon enough this skill-set will become huge. Keep in mind that ONLY after implementing a solution, submitting it and getting it accepted, you can say that you upsolved the problem.

- Solve problems from the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset): CSES problems are designed to teach you famous algorithms and their applications, which is great when you want to learn a topic and want a clear problem about it. You can also find many cool problems in the 'Additional Problems' section, although you might want to wait until you reach a certain level before tackling them. I wouldn't put a quota on how many problems you should solve since their number is pretty much small, but you should solve all problems you know how to solve in the problem set, and when learning a topic you should aim to solve all related problems in it.

## C++ & STL

You should first familiarize yourself with the language you're gonna use to solve problems. Historically, C++ is the most popular language used in Competitive Programming, and also a personal preference, so I'll give you an overview of what we can do using C++. Of course, I assume you already know the language and will instead present to you how to use the STL Library in order to write clean and bug-free code:

- [STL Data Structures](/Competitive%20Programming%20Syllabus/Level%200/STL%20Data%20Structures.cpp): Here's a C++ file introducing various STL Containers/Data Structures.
- [STL Functions](/Competitive%20Programming%20Syllabus/Level%200/STL%20Functions.cpp): Here's a C++ file introducing various STL functions and their applications.

I will also include a list of blogs discussing various C++ tricks that you might find interesting:
