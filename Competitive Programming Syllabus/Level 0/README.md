## Notes about Problem Solving

First of all, congratulations on your decision to start learning and practicing Competitive Programming! Here are some blogs discussing how to approach and think about a specific problem...

Before moving to the next step, starting our problem solving journey, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/csMajors/comments/xi6knk/there_is_nothing_better_than_grinding_leetcode/) is a Reddit post funnily addressing problem solving, and I hope that along the way you'll be able to relate to its essence.

## C++ & STL

You should first familiarize yourself with the language you're gonna use to solve problems. Historically, C++ is the most popular language used in Competitive Programming, and also a personal preference, so I'll give you an overview of what we can do using C++. Of course, I assume you already know the language and will instead present to you how to use the STL Library in order to write clean and bug-free code:

1. [STL Data Structures](/Competitive%20Programming%20Syllabus/Level%200/STL%20Data%20Structures.cpp): Here's a C++ file introducing various STL Containers/Data Structures.
2. [STL Functions](/Competitive%20Programming%20Syllabus/Level%200/STL%20Functions.cpp): Here's a C++ file introducing various STL functions and their applications.

I will also include a list of blogs discussing various C++ tricks that you might find interesting:
