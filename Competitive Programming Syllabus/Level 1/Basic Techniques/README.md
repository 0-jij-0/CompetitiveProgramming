# Basic Techniques

Here you will find techniques that do not fall under any specific category, but which are nonetheless really important and helpful in a wide range of problems.

## Binary Search

You can find a comprehensive and high-quality Binary Search Tutorial on [Codeforces EDU](https://codeforces.com/edu/course/2). I highly encourage you to watch all videos and solve all problems in this tutorial.

Here are some additional practice problems.

| Easy                                           | Medium                                        | Hard                                          |

## Difference Array

By the end of Level 0, you should have learned how to find prefix sums and suffix sums using STL functions. [Here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/78762) is a blog describing what a difference array is and what type of problems can it solve. More generally, I would like to point out that it is most useful when we are asked to increment ranges in an array and we only care about the array AFTER all queries have been processed. The blog and comments include some practice problems related to this technique, and here are few more:
